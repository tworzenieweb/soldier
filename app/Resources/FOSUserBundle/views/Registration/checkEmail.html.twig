    <h2>Dear Soldier</h2>

            <p>You might be asking yourself, "Why do I want to sign up?"</p>

            <p>You, Dear Soldier, with your dedication of your time and your daily efforts, are doing it not
            only to protect your own home, or your own family and friends. You are doing all of these acts
            for the entire Jewish people, so the Jewish people will have a its own homeland, and will have
            a place that unites the entire Jewish people.  We admire your efforts and are eternally grateful.</p>

            <p>In your unit, you focus on a group effort. You give every ounce of your strength in
            training, in serving. The success of your pluga depends on everyone's success. Itâ€™s no
            different here. Unity is what we are striving for. You can help teach the Jewish People that
            we're all in it together - it is truly a group effort.</p>

            <p>Here's how it works.  <strong><em>In your merit</em></strong>, a girl in Florida runs errands for an elderly
            woman who is homebound. A young man in Paris volunteers to become a big brother to
            a troubled teen. A middle-aged woman in Los Angeles takes upon herself to study the Book
            of Ruth with her friend. A man in Jerusalem studies an extra half hour of Talmud every
            night. We spiritually watch your back while you guard us. Think of it as a "spiritual iron dome".</p>

            <p>You can increase our interconnectedness.</p>

            <p>You can make the world a better place.</p>
